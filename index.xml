      <description>Hello friend.
Whether you are someone who found my website through my resume or from word of mouth, I appreciate you taking the time to learn about me.
To start, my name is Kevin Tsoi and I am a data analyst. My hobbies include playing Tetris, eatting ramen, and learning about artificial intelligence. I generally like to try out new things (with the exception of anything involving heights or bugs) and a firm believer of trying things first before I make my opinion.</description>
